# CPE357Project4
This repository is a project completed by Piper Feldman for CPE357. It is meant to read in and identify the amount of unique words in either
a file or an input from command line. It should also be able to identify the most frequently used words. The amount of words identified depends on
a user-specified flag from command line. If no flag is specified, then the program will print all of the most frequently used words up to the top 30.
